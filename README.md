about texwww / project 2 feedback
================================

Difficulties:

-For a pure beginner, it takes too much time to understand what tools and programms you have to use in order to 
	start and finish the whole project. Personally, I had never "set up a server" before, not even connected 
	to a remote vm via ssh. It would be nice if some tools where mentioned to me, like "putty" for the ssh connection,
	"x2go client" for the graphical environment (which I used for okeanos vm and... felt really nice!, but still not 
	mandatory), "winSCP" to upload our files to the VM, or even some articles about installing "tomcat" and "xampp"/"lamp" 
	to our centOS 7 machines. I don't say that its hard to find some info about installing all this, but for someone new 
	like me, you don't really know which way you have to go and you feel lost in the process. It would be nice to have 
	"global" info as a group (talking about the texwww student-group).
	
-Unexpected error 500 while setting up wordpress in uth VM, very *time-consuming*, very unlucky
	-resolved by downloading and extracting wordpress file once again in the same directory
	
-Searching the whole web on how to deploy my project in tomcat 
	-found out about winSCP, nice tool
	
-error 500 on my dynamic page
	-I couldn't resolve this one.
	-I tested my project in netbeans, worked fine. When I deployed it on tomcat and tried to test it, I was getting 
		this error while trying to get a *response* from the page.
